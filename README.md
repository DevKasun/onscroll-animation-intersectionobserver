# onscroll-animation-intersectionobserver
 This Github repository contains a collection of on-scroll animation scripts that utilize the IntersectionObserver API. With this API, developers can easily detect when an element enters or exits the viewport, making it possible to create dynamic and engaging animations that are triggered by user scrolling. The repository includes several examples of how to use this technique to create different types of animations, such as fading in images, sliding in text, and scaling elements. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository offers a valuable starting point for creating engaging and interactive web experiences.
